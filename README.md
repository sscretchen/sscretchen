<h2>🦇 Utility Belt</h2>
<h3>A list of my security tools and their use</h3>
<table class="ws-table-all">
  <tbody><tr>
    <th>Security Tool</th>
    <th>Use Cases</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Wazuh</td>
    <td>SIEM. This was an easy solution that integrates various OS platforms. I use this to monitor an Ubuntu, RHEL, and windows machine for various testing.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>SecurityOnion</td>
    <td>SOAR. I could not find a tool reasonably priced so this was a great tool. This acts as an HIDS for my Windows VM, and integrates directly with Wazuh. Keeping things uniform  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>TheHive</td>
    <td>SOC operations is a big interest of mine and this tool acts as my IR platform.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>TRAM</td>
    <td>Threat Research. Sticking to established framworks like ATT&CK will keep me honest with the most up to date information in intellegence. I use this for parsing information from security articles and mapping key words/phrases to ATT&CK techniques</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>VS Code</td>
    <td>IDE of choice. VS is helpful because of its built in tools but specifically the ATT&CK extension (VSCode ATT&CK). That extension has a feature that lets you create MD files with direct links to MITRE ATT&CK website and their extensive knowledge base</td>
