<table class="ws-table-all">
  <tbody><tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>Use Cases</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Wazuh</td>
    <td>SIEM. This was an easy solution that integrates various OS platforms. I use this to monitor an Ubuntu, RHEL, and windows machine for various testing.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>SecurityOnion</td>
    <td>SOAR. I could not find a tool reasonably priced so this was a great tool. This acts as an HIDS for my Windows VM, and integrates directly with Wazuh. Keeping things tightly integrated.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Suricata</td>
    <td>I dabbled in Snort and Zeek, but I found Suricata to be the easiest to implement, and configure for ingestion to Wazuh. It also acts as an IPS, which will help with future incident simulations.</td>
  </tr>    
  <tr>
    <td>TheHive</td>
    <td>SOC operations is a big interest of mine and this tool acts as my IR platform.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>TRAM</td>
    <td>Threat Research. Sticking to established framworks like ATT&CK will keep me honest with the most up to date information in intellegence. I use this for parsing information from CTI reports and mapping key words/phrases to ATT&CK techniques to identify IOA.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>VS Code</td>
    <td>IDE of choice. VS is helpful because of its built in tools but specifically the ATT&CK extension (VSCode ATT&CK). That extension has a feature that lets you create MD files with direct links to MITRE ATT&CK website and their extensive knowledge base. VS also supports YARA</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>PeStudio</td>
    <td>Take a peek into files for potential malware. I usually pull them into a VM environment to run this analysis</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>CyberChef</td>
    <td>A very fun tool for all sorts of cyber-shenanigans. Encoding and encryption, calculating hashes and many other useful activites. I enjoy this tool because it runs in the browser. No complicated setup or builds.</td>
  </tr>
